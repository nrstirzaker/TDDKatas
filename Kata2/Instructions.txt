You have a data class called ProcessData which holds 3 values

processedId : long
processStatus : ready,processed,failed
startDate : date




You need to create a function that given one or many ProcessData objects returns a Map of type Map<Long,List<ProcessData>>
where the Long value is the processId of all the ProcessData objects in the List. 
This means that processId is not unique.


Write your tests first you will need to us the JUnitParams library
